# AI News Analysis on Effects on Jobs and What Can AI Do
In March of 2023, Goldman Sachs published a reportLinks to an external site., indicating that ~25% of the tasks in US and Europe can be automated using AI.  However, as you can see in this visualizationLinks to an external site., not all industries will be affected equally.  According to the report, certain jobs, like office tasks, legal, architecture and social sciences have a potential for 30%+ automation, while positions like construction, installation and building maintenance are going to be largely unaffected.

While both of these papers are very impressive, they also heavily influenced by the recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs).  For this final project there is a collection of ~200K news articles (about 900 MB) articles on topics: Data Science, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence, and the task is to identify what industries and job lines are going to be most impacted by the AI over the next several years, based on the information that can be disseminated from this text corpus.

The objective of this project is to identify what types of tasks and jobs are most likely to see the biggest impact from AI by extracting meaningful insights from unstructured text.  The goal is to provide actionable recommendations on what can be done with AI to automate the jobs and / or improve employee productivity.  Please pay attention to the introduction of novel technologies and algorithms, such as AI for image generation and Conversational AI, as they represent the entire paradigm shift in adoption of AI technologies and data science in general.
